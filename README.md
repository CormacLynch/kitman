Kitman Labs Challenge

- Questions 1 and 2 can be found in the word document named: Kitman Labs.
- Question 3 can be found at 'themes/base/js/exercises/flatten.js' all the code has been commented on here. It is exicuted by index.js found at 'themes/base/js/index.js'. And the result can be seen in the console once you open the index.html webpage.
- Question 4 can be seen once a localhost has been created for the project. Technologies used JS, ReactJS, HTML5 and CSS with BEM. All my written JS can be found in 'themes/base/js/app' and 'themes/base/js/components', all weitten CSS can be found in 'themes/base/css/less'.

My code is preprocessed using webpack from the 'themes/base' folder run **yarn install** to install all the modules then **yarn start** for unminified and **yarn prod** for minified CSS and JS.

Disclaimer
I haven't included any Unit test cases as I haven't developed or used them yet in my career, but I hope all the other work i've done makes up for it. I have tested my work thoroughly with Chrome. I have really enjoyed this challenge and I thank you for the opportunity.
