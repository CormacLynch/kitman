- Question 4 can be seen once a localhost has been created for the project. Technologies used JS, ReactJS, HTML5 and CSS with BEM.

Disclaimer
I haven't included any Unit test cases as I haven't developed or used them yet in my career, but I hope all the other work i've done makes up for it. I have tested my work thoroughly with Chrome. I have really enjoyed this challenge and I thank you for the opportunity.
